They offer extremely fast speeds and are ideal for high-volume tasks where raw performance matters."},{question:"What is the difference between shared and private datacenter proxies?",answer:"Shared datacenter proxies are used by multiple customers simultaneously, keeping costs low. Private datacenter proxies are dedicated to your account exclusively, providing better performance and lower block rates."},{question:"How fast are datacenter proxies compared to residential?",answer:"Datacenter proxies are significantly faster, typically offering sub-50ms latency and higher bandwidth since they run on enterprise-grade server infrastructure."},{question:"Can I use datacenter proxies for web scraping?",answer:"Yes. Datacenter proxies work well for scraping sites that don't have aggressive anti-bot protections. For heavily protected targets, consider pairing with residential proxies."},{question:"Do you support HTTP and HTTPS with datacenter proxies?",answer:"Yes.
