They are static residential addresses hosted on servers, giving you fast, persistent connections that appear as genuine ISP-assigned IPs."},{question:"How are ISP proxies different from residential proxies?",answer:"Residential proxies rotate through peer-to-peer IPs and may have variable speeds. ISP proxies are static, hosted on fast servers, and registered under real ISPs — they offer consistent speed with residential-level trust."},{question:"Can I keep the same ISP proxy IP for extended periods?",answer:"Yes. ISP proxies are static by nature, meaning you keep the same IP for the lifetime of your subscription. This makes them ideal for long-running sessions and account management."},{question:"What authentication do ISP proxies support?",answer:"Both IP allowlist and username:password authentication are supported.
